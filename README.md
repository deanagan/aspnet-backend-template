# ASP.Net Backend Template
 This is a basic template I've written for code katas or mini code demos using
 asp.net and C#. It has xunit testing and logging included.



# To build and test
I've added some batch files for windows setup.
To run API: `dotnet run -p Api` <br>
To just build: `dotnet build` <br>
To run test: `dotnet test` <br>
To run test verbose + logging: `dotnet test -l:"console;verbosity=detailed"`
